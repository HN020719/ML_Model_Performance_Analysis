# ML_Model_Performance_Analysis_On_Spam_Information

## Overview
This project involves the analysis and modeling of a spam information dataset using various machine-learning techniques. The dataset is preprocessed and visualized, followed by training and evaluating models such as logistic regression, LDA, QDA, SVM, and tree-based methods. 

## Files
- `analysis.Rmd`: RMarkdown file containing the complete code for data preprocessing, visualization, and model training.
- `analysis.pdf`: PDF version of the complete analysis.
- `spam-info.txt`: Raw data file used for analysis.
